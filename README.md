# Quiz
For this project the request was to build a JavaScript Code Quiz that should contain the following:

When the start button is clicked, a timer should start when the question comes up. After a question is answered, the next question should come up. If the answer is incorrect, time is subtracted from the clock.
Finally, when either all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. At the end, the player should be able to save their initials along with their score.
